# Fermi OS

Fermi OS is a bare-metal `aarch64 (ARMv8-A)` kernel built from scratch in `C` and assembly, targeting QEMU's `virt` machine with a Cortex-A72 processor.

## Prerequisites
> Note: This project is being developed and tested on Mac M4 chip. There is a possibility that you might encounter environment setup errors on other platforms.

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com) on your host machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rituparna-ui/fermi-os.git
cd fermi-os

docker run -d -it -v .:/root/fermi-os --name osdev ubuntu
```

Once the Docker container is up and running, start a shell in the container that was just created.
```bash
docker exec -it osdev bash
```

Inside the Docker container, install required dependencies.
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade

apt install make qemu-system gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gdb-multiarch tmux
ln -sf aarch64-linux-gnu-as /usr/bin/as
```

## Building & Running

```bash
# Build the kernel ELF
make

# Build and run in QEMU (serial console)
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

To exit QEMU: `Ctrl-A` then `X`

## Debugging

```bash
# Launch QEMU paused + GDB in a tmux split
make tmux
```

Or manually in two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: QEMU waiting for debugger
make debug

# Terminal 2: GDB connecting to QEMU
make gdb
```

### Other Utilities

```bash
# Generate compile_commands.json for clangd / IDE support
make compile_commands.json

# Dump QEMU device tree source (DTS)
make dump_dts
```

## Features

- **PL011 UART Driver** — Full serial I/O, hex/decimal/binary output and formatted print with `%s %d %u %x %p %b %c %%` format specifiers
- **Physical Memory Manager (PMM)** — Bitmap-based page allocator managing 8 GB of RAM, with single and contiguous multi-page allocation
- **MMU (Memory Management Unit)** — 3-level page tables (L0→L1→L2) with 2 MB blocks, 48-bit virtual address space, 4 KB granule
- **Higher-Half Kernel** — Dual address space with TTBR0 (identity map) and TTBR1 (`0xFFFF_0000_0000_0000+` → PA `0x0+`)
- **Kernel Heap** — First-fit allocator with block splitting, coalescing, double-free detection, and bounds checking (`kmalloc`/`kfree`)
- **Exception Handling** — Full ARMv8-A vector table, trap frame save/restore, ESR decoding, register dump on fault
- **GICv3 Interrupt Controller** — Minimal GICv3 bringup with Distributor/Redistributor initialization, affinity routing, system register interface, IRQ acknowledge/EOI
- **ARM Generic Timer** — Configurable periodic tick (default 1 s) driving the scheduler, routed through GICv3 PPI
- **Preemptive Scheduler** — Round-robin task scheduler with timer-driven preemption, per-task kernel stacks, context switching via callee-saved register save/restore, task creation/exit/reaping lifecycle, and a circular run queue
- **Kernel Panic Handler** — System register dump and CPU halt on unrecoverable errors
